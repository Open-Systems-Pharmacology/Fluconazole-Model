### 2.2.2 Clinical data

A literature search was performed to collect available clinical data on fluconazole in adults. 

The following publications were found in adults for model building:

| Publication                   | Arm / Treatment / Information used for model building        |
| :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |

The following table shows the data from the excretion studies ([Shiba 1990](#5-references)) used for model building:

| Observer                                                     | Value |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| Fraction excreted  to urine of unchanged fluconazole after iv administration 25 mg | 74%   |
| Fraction excreted  to urine of unchanged fluconazole after iv administration 25 mg | 72%   |
| Fraction excreted  to urine of unchanged fluconazole after oral administration 25 mg | 69%   |
| Fraction excreted  to urine of unchanged fluconazole after oral administration 50 mg | 67%   |
| Fraction excreted  to urine of unchanged fluconazole after oral administration 100 mg | 75%   |



The following dosing scenarios were simulated and compared to respective data for model verification:
